# Shell-programing     
PS. I am using WSL for running shell scripts, and I am not sure how to use the repositories along side that so I will be harnessing the "upload" feature on this repo     


### Day-1      
- Learnt about how shell programing works
- Made a simple program saying "Hi" to my mom
- Also learnt about how parameters are passed and how are variables used and declared in shell programing
- And learnt how to take user input for any of the variables
