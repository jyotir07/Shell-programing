# Shell-programing     
PS. I am using WSL for running shell scripts, and I am not sure how to use the repositories along side that so I will be harnessing the "upload" feature on this repo     


### Day-1      
- Learnt about how shell programing works
- Made a simple program saying "Hi" to my mom
- Also learnt about how parameters are passed and how are variables used and declared in shell programing
- And learnt how to take user input for any of the variables

### Day-2
- Learnt how to use inbuilt variables
- Also how to make our own variable and then make it useable by the children
- "Export" comand makes the variable useable by the children (other files)


Note: To further use the export variable even after reopening the linux or wsl, we need to edit the ".bashrc" file. (Which I did)
